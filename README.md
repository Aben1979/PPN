Hey there!

I am [snovvcrash](https://snovvcrash.rocks/about) and that's a gitbook for keeping my pentest notes on hand. It's far from being perfect in terms of organization (that's why I call it "promiscuous") and, basically, I'm logging it for myself, but it turned out that hosting it online is the most convenient way to access it. So, if you find it handy too, feel free to use it... **responsibly**, of course!

The previous version of PPN is [here](https://snovvcrash.rocks/PPN/) (deprecated).
