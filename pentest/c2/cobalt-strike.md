## P2P Beacons

Beacon TCP and Beacon SMB are Peer-to-Peer beacons which means they're used to chain a connection to an existent beacon. They act like bind shells and waits for the attacker to connect to them.

Connect to a TCP beacon:

```
beacon> connect <IP> <PORT>
```

Connect to an SMB beacon:

```
beacon> link <IP>
```
